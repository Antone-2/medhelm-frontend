## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues to Resolve

### Payment 500 Error
The 500 Internal Server Error during payment initiation is likely caused by:
1. Missing or incorrect PesaPal environment variables
2. Network connectivity issues with PesaPal API
3. Invalid callback URL configuration

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Check and set all required PesaPal environment variables in `.env`
2. Run the PesaPal test script to verify API connectivity
3. Ensure the callback URL is accessible and properly configured

### Next Steps
1. Set environment variables
2. Test PesaPal integration
3. Deploy to staging environment
4. Perform end-to-end testing
5. Deploy to production
